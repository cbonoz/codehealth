The token NAME should be one of those: AMPER_EQUAL, CIRCUMFLEX_EQUAL, COLON, COMMA, COMMENT, DOUBLE_SLASH_EQUAL, DOUBLE_STAR_EQUAL, ENDL, EQUAL, LEFT_SHIFT_EQUAL, MINUS_EQUAL, PERCENT_EQUAL, PLUS_EQUAL, RIGHT_PARENTHESIS, RIGHT_SHIFT_EQUAL, SEMICOLON, SLASH_EQUAL, STAR_EQUAL, VBAR_EQUAL

It is not normal that you see this error, it means that Baron has failed to parse valid Python code. It would be kind if you can extract the snippet of your code that makes Baron fail and open a bug here: https://github.com/Psycojoker/baron/issues

Sorry for the inconvenience.
